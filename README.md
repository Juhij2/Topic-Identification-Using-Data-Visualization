# Topic-Identification-Using-Data-Visualization

In this project, I developed a data visualization tool to identify topics from text data. The tool uses a word cloud to visualize the most common words in the dataset after preprocessing, including removing stop words, tokenization, and lemmatization. The word cloud can be interacted with by selecting a word to see its relationship with other words in the sentence using the network_x graph.

By analyzing the trends and patterns of the text data through these visualizations, an educated guess about the topic of the dataset can be made. This project demonstrates the use of data visualization techniques to gain insights from unstructured text data.

The project can be run by inputting a dataset of text data and running the Python script, which will preprocess the data, generate the word cloud, and create the network_x graph for word relationships. The code is available on GitHub for others to explore and use.
